3.0 System Description
3.1 System Purpose
The Online Flight Booking System is a platform that aims to aid the clients through providing
an automated ticket reservation system that is quick and simple.
3.2 System Functions
This project is divided into two sections in terms of user restriction, the admin and the
client/visitor.


Admin Functions:
● The admin will store and maintain all flight schedules into the system along with the
airline information.
● Flight details and other data will be filtered according to the client's desired schedule,
which will be updated from the admin side.


Client Functions:
● The clients can search/browse through the flight schedules.
● They can sort their search according to their preferred airlines.
4.0 System Problems and Weaknesses
● The web pages are not secured enough, which may result in unauthorised access.
● The HTML and CSS used are outdated which may lead to system unresponsiveness.
● The web pages are not linked with each other correctly.
● The logout function is not working.
● The system is unable to detect if a user is an admin or a client.5.0 Components to be maintained
